# What is NoSQL?

- Non-relational
- No data normalization
- Not-Only SQL

NoSQL data is also described as **non-relational data** or **non-SQL data** indicating the data storage and retrieval mechanism is modeled differently compared to the table based normalized data storage and retrieval mechanism of relational databases.

Even though this type of data storage has been around for longer, NoSQL databases became mainstream in the last 10 to 15 years starting with the rise of Web 2.0 products like social media, sharing services and the proliferation of web scale data stores to support these services.

NoSQL systems are also sometimes called **Not-Only SQL** to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL database in a polyglot persistence architecture.
